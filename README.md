# Simple Shell Project

A simple shell project in C, typically involves creating a basic command-line interpreter that can execute user commands. This kind of project is often used for educational purposes to understand how operating systems handle processes and user inputs. Our task in this simple shell project is to implement the actual shell where we call out the path of executable commands written in by the user to execute them.

#Objective
- Understand how a shell works.
- How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs.
- How to create processes.


## Repository File

####
| Files  | Functions |
| :-----   | :--------- |
| `main.h` | File that contains all necessary headers that allows several functions to perform operations.
| `command.h` | File that contains all necessary headers that allows several functions to perform operations. |
| `main.c` |  File that calls an infinite loop to find the necessary path to call out.   |
| `check_path_execute.c | File that checks for path and execution, to check if command is executable  |
| `execute_command.c` | File that execute the command within the process, handling errors or statuses |
| `find_command.c` |  File that search for the executable given command |
| `get_environ.c` | File search for PATH environment variable and retrieves its value. It locates path of executable programs which it allows the shell to locate and execute commands entered by users. |
| `is_full_path.c` | File checks if given command is a full path or not. |
| `make_path.c` | File creates full path by combining directory path and command name. |
| `max_ppid`   |   File script that is used to find the process of the PPID.      |
| `README.md`  |   Description file of the project.       |

## How 'Simple Shell' Works:

A simple shell allows the users to input commands to direct the system through breaking down the components which it runs into a infinite loop to locates the executable command listed in the system's PATH. It thens tokenlized the input to determind the wanted command. On each commands a child process is created which then, the parent process waits for the child process to be excecuted. As it locates the command's path it prints out the located memories.
