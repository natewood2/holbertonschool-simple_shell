.SH Simple Shell
[Shell] A program that takes command from the user and pass it to the operating system to execute.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Simple Shell is tasked with interpreting commands from the user, running in an infinite loop to find and verify called paths. It checks if paths exist and are executable. If valid, it executes the command; if not, it exits and restarts the loop.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Return values varies depending on user input. Returns exit codes: -1 for success, 1 for errors.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B $ /bin/ls -l
Lists files in long format.
.TP
.B $ /bin/echo "Hello World"
Prints "Hello World" to the terminal.
.SH BUGS
The `ls` command, while operational, may not return output in the expected format. Specifically, the command executes successfully, but the length of the output might differ from the checker. This does not affect the functionality of the `ls` command in listing directory contents, but users should be aware of the potential discrepancy in output format. Ongoing efforts are being made to align the output with conventional `ls` command behavior.
We are also experiencing a memory issue regrading 120 bytes of reachable memory in the exit function. Exit should work without issue but this does not meet the checkers requirements.
Also, env not returning the needed status to pass the checker.
